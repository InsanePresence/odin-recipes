    <ol>
        <li>Go somewhere suitable to craft your lasagna.</li>
        <li>Clear your mind and body of all distractions.</li>
        <li>Determine the direction the wind is blowing.</li>
        <li>Put your back to the wind and place your ingredients in front of you on a table or something, the ground works too I guess.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven I never mentioned before this to like a cooking temperature, so hot probably.</li>

        <li>Throw that greasy bitch in the oven.</li>
        <li>Stare for approximately 2,700 seconds.</li>
        <li>Take it out before it burns you fucking cave man.</li>
